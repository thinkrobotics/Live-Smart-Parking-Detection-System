# Car Parking Space Detection Project

This project demonstrates a simple car parking space detection system using OpenCV and cvzone. It allows you to mark parking spaces on a static image, and then it detects the occupancy of these spaces in a video feed.

## Overview

The main goal of this project is to detect and monitor car parking spaces. It consists of two main parts:

1. **parkingspacepicker.py**: This Python script allows you to manually select parking space coordinates on a static image (`carParkImg.png`). You can left-click to mark parking spaces and right-click to remove them. The coordinates are saved in a file named `CarParkPos` using pickle.

2. **main.py**: This Python script reads the saved parking space coordinates and processes a video feed (`carPark.mp4`) to detect the occupancy of parking spaces. It displays the video with marked parking spaces and updates the count of free spaces in real-time.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/harshbafnaa/car-parking-detection.git](https://github.com/thinkrobotics/Live-Smart-Parking-Detection-System.git)
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies, including OpenCV and cvzone:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python-headless
   pip install numpy
   pip install cvzone
   ```

3. Ensure you have the following files in your project folder:

   - `carPark.mp4` (video file)
   - `carParkImg.png` (static image of the parking lot)
   - `parkingspacepicker.py`
   - `main.py`

## Usage

1. Run `parkingspacepicker.py` to mark the parking spaces on the static image. Left-click to add parking spaces and right-click to remove them. The coordinates will be saved in `CarParkPos`.

2. Run `main.py` to start processing the video feed and detecting parking space occupancy. The video will display with marked parking spaces and a count of free spaces.

## Files and Folders

- `carPark.mp4`: Input video file containing the parking lot footage.
- `carParkImg.png`: Static image of the parking lot for marking parking spaces.
- `parkingspacepicker.py`: Script to select and save parking space coordinates.
- `main.py`: Script for processing the video and detecting parking space occupancy.
- `CarParkPos`: Binary file containing saved parking space coordinates (created by `parkingspacepicker.py`).
